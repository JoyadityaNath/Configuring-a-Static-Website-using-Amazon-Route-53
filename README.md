# Static-Website-using-Route53
This repository is a small personal project and a stepping stone for my cloud journey. Here I will share how to create a simple static website and host it online using cloud tools like Amazon S3, Route 53, CloudFront, Amazon Certificate Manager etc. along with sharing all the possible difficulties and errors one might encounter while performing this project. Separate markup files have been created for each AWS service used in this project, which contain basic information about the AWS service, how to configure it for this Project, and what all things could go wrong while configuring them.
Screenshots have also been included to guide the reader through each step. Feel free to contribute to this repository, any corrections or additions or new ideas are welcome.

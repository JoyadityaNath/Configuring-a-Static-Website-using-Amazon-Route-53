Amazon Route 53 is a service that helps us achieve 3 things namely:
1) Registering Domains
2) Routing internet traffic to domains(DNS)
3) Checking the health of our resources such as web servers or pages.
In this project, the first two services of Amazon Route 53 will be used. Route 53 serves other purposes as well, such as a DNS Resolver. For more information about what all things Route 53 can do check out https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html.
